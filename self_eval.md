# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I think I am struggling to know the difference between using quotation marks, colons, and hash rockets.  When you call keys and values back or even add new ones, how do those come into play?

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I LOVE notion!  I have been using it for a while but didn't realize it had coding shortcuts/integrations which has bene very helpful.  I find I take the best notes as I go through the visual lessons!

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I usually try to solve a problem on my own first. I will switch things around a bit before making a google search.  I learn much better hands on!
